\begin{abstract}
Power, size and weight are major constraining factors for UAVs, which have caused researchers to investigate alternative information representations, such as semantics, to reduce the computational load onboard UAVs. However, the connection between spatial and semantic information is not fully explored and the literature on including semantic information for UAV navigation is limited. This paper aims to provide a taxonomoy on spatial and semantic relations through consideration of a selected subset of literature. Concepts of semantic information are related with spatial maps and two hypotheses for improving algorithms based on the literature are generated. The algorithms are tested in numerical simulations on the task of semantic mapping and the effects of influential parameters are examined. Results indicate that a defined hierarchical structure of semantic information allows for improved map reproduction. The presented approach exhibits the potential to improve the use of semantic information in UAV deployment scenarios, such as agriculture, search and rescue or industrial inspections.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:Intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Limitations in power, size and weight in UAVs have resulted in researchers exploring alternative approaches of representing information to reduce the computational load onboard UAVs. Contextual information is often used for navigation, with semantics at the frontier of contemporary robotics research showing promising results. Kostavelis and Gasteratos define semantics as ''[...] related to the study between signs and the things to which they refer, that is their meaning.''~\cite{kostavelis_semantic_2015}. Semantic information has been included into the passive part of SLAM~\cite{cadena_past_2016,zhang_hierarchical_2019}, as well as into active path planning~\cite{koch_automatic_2019,alirezaie_exploiting_2017}.  However, in terms of semantic signal source, multiple levels of signals are possible, such as individual objects, regions or areas~\cite{kostavelis_semantic_2015}. These cause new problems for definining successful navigation, as highlighted by Anderson~\etal~\cite{anderson_evaluation_2018}. Furthermore, recent advances in Computer Vision have produced a wide range of different sensors signals to be annotated with semantic information, such as pixel-level segmentation, object detection or scene classification~\cite{alom_history_2018}, which operate on different spatial levels.
\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption{\bf{An example of a UAV performing a semantic mapping task on an urban area, demonstrated by assigning colors to grid maps. Blue fields represent cars, green fields houses, gray fields roads. Light green denotes grass and dark green trees.}}
    \label{fig:AerialImg}
\end{figure}
The influence of these sensor signals on the level of names on conventional robotics algorithms, such as filters and path planners, is an active field of research~\cite{kostavelis_semantic_2015,cadena_past_2016,anderson_evaluation_2018}. UAVs are impacted by unique viewing angles, as well as risk-averse requirements and hard constraints on computational resources~\cite{mandel_method_2020,gonzalez_unmanned_2016,boroujerdian_mavbench_2018}, which add additional complexity to the problem of semantic based navigation.

With the aim of identifying factors of success for employing semantic information in robotics research, a taxonomy of a selected subset of literature is conducted. Following a generic algorithm development approach as depcicted in figure~\ref{fig:DevProcess}, an algorithm based on the gathered insights is proposed and tested in simulations. Initial simulation results are used to indicate the direction of further research for employing semantic information in UAV navigation.

This paper is split into two parts: the first part is concerned with a taxonomy of a selected subset of literature on semantic navigation. The second part contains the proposal of an algorithm based on conclusions drawn from the literature, which is evaluated in numerical simulations. The subsequent sections -- Methodology, Results and Discussion -- are each split into two parts, where the first part is concerned with the taxonomy and the second part with the simulation.   
\section{Methodology} \label{sec:Met}
In this paper we evaluate a selected subset of literature, which combines semantic signals with spatial information in robotics to demonstrate the state of the research. The literature is categorised with respect to different dimensions. In the second section the information from the literature is used to improve semantic mapping of a two-dimensional occupancy grid map and it is shown how parameters surrounding the quality of observations, overlap and field of view influence a Bayesian filter approach. The filter is supplemented through an informed prior and the effectiveness is demonstrated in numerical simulations. This research is directed towards enhancing the performance of a module which is tasked with extracting and evaluating the semantic information during UAV path planning in a navigational framework~\cite{mandel_towards_2020}.
\subsection{Literature Taxonomy} \label{ssec:MetLit}
Twenty-six papers were selected for this research. The papers are sorted according to the following three dimensions and the methods employed in those papers are extracted:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Robot Type
    \item Spatial Map
    \item Semantic Map
\end{enumerate}
A discussion on the results for the literature taxonomy is presented in section~\ref{ssec:ResLit} and illustrated by figure~\ref{fig:LitRes}.

The information from the literature is used to derive an algorithm following the development pipeline as shown in figure~\ref{fig:DevProcess}. Following the proposal of an algorithm, numerical simulations are conducted to highlight the improved performance. The results from the numerical simulation are presented in section~\ref{ssec:ResSim} and conclusions for future developments and potential integration into higher level architectures are drawn in section~\ref{ssec:DiscSim}.
\subsection{Simulations} \label{ssec:MetSim}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=3.25in]{2-3DevelopmentCycle.png}\\
    \caption{\bf{A generic autonomy development cycle as proposed by Ladosz~\etal~\protect\cite{ladosz_generic_2019}}}
    \label{fig:DevProcess}
\end{figure}

The literature taxonomy uncovered that a substantial part of semantics research in robtoics benefits from hybrid approaches along the spatial and semantic axes, denoted by the centralised cluster in figure~\ref{fig:LitRes}. UAVs are constrained by additional layers of complexity in translation of conventional semantic detection methods and deployment~\cite{mandel_method_2020}. As a result, the development pipeline shown in figure~\ref{fig:DevProcess} is followed to evaluate the proposed approach in numerical simulations.

Numerical simulations are conducted to expose influences of parameters of the mapping pipeline and differences between algorithms. Figure~\ref{fig:SimCase} shows the setup of the simulation. The task is to recreate a map from sequential, noisy semantic observations. The map is an evenly spaced 2D grid $M \times M$ defined by a one-hot vector of the true identity, $x_{i,j} = \{0,..., 1, ..., 0\}_K$, with $K$ indicating the number of classes. The probability of making an observation $z$ is given by $p(z\mid x)$. The pose is assumed to be known for the entire trajectory. At each time increment $t$ the UAV observes cells within its field of view $f$, receives a one-hot observation proportional to $p(z\mid x)$ and updates the posterior of each map cell given by Bayes' rule as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Bayes}
    p(x\mid z) = \frac{p(z\mid x) p(x)}{p(z)}
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to the performance of any given detector~\cite{alom_history_2018}.
\begin{figure*}[t]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=3.5in]{SimComp13.png}

    }}
    \label{fig:SimCase}
\end{figure*}

The UAV is following a conventional lawnmower pattern, where the stride in both dimensions is defined through a desired overlap $o$ and field of view $f$~\cite{shetty_implementation_2020}. Figure~\ref{fig:SimCase} d) shows a snapshot of the simulation at time $t=47$. The green cells in the figure indicate the cells that have already been observed, the red cells the current $f$ of the UAV, which is marked by the black $\pmb{\times}$. The blue cells denote the cells where the prior $p(x)$ has been predicted at $t_{-1}$, based on the posterior of the red cells.

Four algorithms are compared in parallel with the same sampled observations. In all cases, only the prior $p(x)$ for each cell is predicted and all subsequent observations are incorporated according to equation~\ref{eq:Bayes}. In the baseline case (algorithm 1), the prior for each cell $p(x)$ is uniform over all classes $K$, which is denoted as a Naive Bayes Filter. In the other three cases, spatial correlation is incorporated into the prior. The prediction for the cells is made by extracting the next waypoint $t_{+1}$ and evaluating all cells that will be visible within the field-of-view $f$ at that timestep. In the second algorithm (algorithm 2), yet unobserved cells receive a prior which is a linear combination of the uniform prior and the posterior of the already observed cells. The posterior probability is weighted by a mixing parameter $\alpha \in [0, 1]$, as well as the ratio of number of observed cells divided by total cells -- defined through the overlap $o$ and $f$ -- and used as a prior for the yet unobseved cells.

The other two algorithms are based on assumptions drawn from the results of the literature taxonomy as detailed in section~\ref{ssec:ResLit}. Incorporating information in a hierarchical context has proven successful in related semantic fields, such as speech processing~\cite{fine_hierarchical_1998} and topic modelling~\cite{blei_latent_2003}. These approaches have been succesfully adapted to related domains, such as image annotation~\cite{fei-fei_bayesian_2005,lienou_semantic_2010} or SLAM~\cite{zhang_hierarchical_2019}. Some algorithms have incorporated the semantic information succesfully for the purpose of navigation~\cite{koch_automatic_2019,chaplot_object_2020,wu_learning_2018,alirezaie_exploiting_2017}.\\
Two algorithms  that recalculate the prior based on hierarchical information are proposed: the prior is calculated according to an assumed distribution of ''areas'' -- $u$ -- groupings of cells. These groupings require the definition of $p(x\mid u)$ and $p(u)$, as well as the number of groupings -- usually smaller than $K$ -- analogous to topic modelling~\cite{blei_latent_2003}. In the third algorithm (algorithm 3), every map cell is assigned a fixed prior of $p(x_{t=0}) = p(x\mid u) p(u)$. In the fourth algorithm (algorithm 4) $p(u)$ is updated dynamically by using the observations of each cell within $f$, with a fixed $p(x\mid u)$, which leads to a new dynamically assigned $p(x)$.

Three variations of $p(u)$ and $p(x\mid u)$ -- denoted by the parameter \emph{Ptu} -- are considered. The first is a manual version, where the mixture of ''objects'' in ''areas'' $p(x\mid u)$ is estimated by the user and the distribution of ''areas'' $p(u)$ in the map as well. In the second and third version, $p(x\mid u)$ and $p(u)$ are derived through Monte-Carlo simulations described in section~\ref{ssec:MetMC}. $K=5$ and $3$ are used for the simulations, because the small number allows for interpretability, visual simplicity and numerical stability when defining and evaluating simulation cases.

Robotics research is often constrained by the overlap of classes available in detection and simulation environments~\cite{chaplot_object_2020}, such that $5$ is a reasonable approximation for numerical research. The chosen classes are distributed according to different scales, with one class being dominant in the map, occupying over $70$\% of the cells in the majority of cases, while another class occupies less that $1$\%. Furthermore, the classes occupy different connected regions of the map, ranging from $1$ isolated cell to multiples of the field-of-view, which allows the investigation how different scales influence the performance.

The simulation cases can be transposed -- indicated by $t$ in figure~\ref{fig:SimCase} c)-- to evaluate the influence of the path planning direction on the predictive performance. The second simulation environment has further boolean parameters, that randomize the placement of objects in quadrants --$r$, as well as a parameter that mixes two quadrants -- $c$ -- to illustrate visual diversity and reduce uniformity of areas.

The simulation cases are displayed in figure~\ref{fig:SimCase} and table~\ref{tab:params} shows the parameters that have been varied.

The mixing parameter $\alpha$ is evaluated in a preliminary set of experiments, where $\alpha \in [0, 0.2, ..., 1]$ and therefore not included in table~\ref{tab:params}.
Figure~\ref{fig:SimCase} shows the basic variations for the simulation environments. The top left is the first environment, which is also used for the Monte-Carlo simulations detailed in section~\ref{ssec:MetMC} and excluded from the evaluation. The top centre shows the second environment, with the top right a transposed environment. The bottom left shows an example path, with the green colour indicating the already explored areas, the red the already seen fields and the blue the yet unexplored fields, which are predicted. The bottom centre shows a case where the placement of objects within their quadrants is randomised. The bottom right shows an environment with partial transpose, which convolutes the definition of an ''area'' as a section identifiable by its composition of objects. The colours are indicators of types of classes and can be interpreted as shown in table~\ref{tab:colors}, however, are not limited to the named classes.
\subsubsection{Monte-Carlo simulations} \label{ssec:MetMC}
$1000$ simulations with fixed $o=0.5$, $f=2$ and
\begin{equation} \nonumber
    p(z\mid x)=
    \begin{cases}
        0.8,~\text{for}~k=x \\
        \frac{1-0.8}{K-1},~\text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
are run on the first environment. $p(u)$ and $p(x\mid u)$ are sampled from a simplex and the performance of each algorithm as defined in section~\ref{ssec:MetEval} and $p(u)$ and $p(x\mid u)$ are saved if:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The log-likelihood is smaller than the current smallest
    \item The difference between the predicted algorithm and the dynamic algorithm is bigger than the current biggest
\end{enumerate}
The final best results are used as parameters $p(u)$ and $p(x\mid u)$ for additional simulations as defined in section~\ref{ssec:MetSim}.
\subsubsection{Evaluation}\label{ssec:MetEval}
The reproduction quality of the posterior map for each individual state was evaluated with the sum over the log-likelihoods for each cell $m_{i,j}$, defined by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Entropy}
    H = - \sum_{i,j,k} p_{i,j,k}~ln(q_{i,j,k})
\end{equation}
is calculated, where $p$ represents the true state and $q$ the estimated map state.\\
For the comparison of different algorithms running with the same parameters, the log-likelihoods for each individual case are subtracted from another and the count of the positive and negative samples indicate the relative quality of the reproduction:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eval}
    \frac{pos}{pos+neg} \in [0, 1]
\end{equation} If the value is below $50$\%, the algorithm performs worse than its compared baseline. This metric is chosen as a robust indicator, which is not affected by large variances for each simulation run caused by the different parameters. 
Only the second simulation environment is included in the evaluation, since the first simulation environment was used in the Monte-Carlo simulationto generate sample probability vectors, as described above.
\section{Results} \label{sec:Res}
\subsection{Literature Taxonomy} \label{ssec:ResLit}
\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Lit-13.png}
    \caption{\bf{
        Categorization of the included literature. The y-axis represents the level of the semantic information, whether objects, areas or a hierarchical combination were used.

The colors represent the type of robot used in the research, with blue denoting UAVs, orange denoting ground robots and green generic research.
    }}
    \label{fig:LitRes}
\end{figure*}
Figure~\ref{fig:LitRes} shows the results of generating a taxonomic representation of the included literature. The literature extends to a selection from 1995 to 2020 and has been classified according to the spatial and semantic maps that were used, as well as the robot type employed in the research. It should be noted that in most cases image space was used to extract semantic information, however, the map retainment is considered as the defining factor for the spatial map. The majority  of research considered in this work is employing a hybrid approach on either the semantic level or the spatial level. A smaller portion considers non-hybrid information and is placed in the corners of the figure.  
\subsubsection{Generic Research} \label{sssec:ResLitHist}
Five research efforts considered as ''generic'' from as early as 1995  have been included in the taxonomy of this paper.\\
Chown and colleagues for example~\cite{chown_prototypes_1995} researched the "what" and "where" subsystems of the human cognition and their learning over time. They captured the influence of landmark recognition, recreation of consistent Euclidean maps, as well as the importance of gateways, representing transitions between regions. Suenderhauf~\etal~\cite{sunderhauf_meaningful_2017} associated point-clouds in SLAM with labels propagated through a modern neural network. Yang~\etal~\cite{yang_visual_2018} used scene priors derived from vector representations of class names to enhance a reinforcement learning module which relies on visual cues in indoor environments. Crespo~\etal~\cite{crespo_reasoning_2018} generalised the implementation of a knowledgebase-system developed by Tenorth~\etal~\cite{tenorth_knowrob-map_2010} to a database implementation and improved the speed significantly. In 2018,Wu~\etal~\cite{wu_learning_2018} used reinforcement learning to train an agent to recognise a room and infer whether one room type is directly or indirectly accessible from another room using a Bernoulli distribution.
\subsubsection{Ground Robots} \label{sssec:ResLitCont}
Eight research efforts from a timespan between 2000 and 2020 have been considered in this taxonomy. Contemporary image processing techniques have accelerated semantic spatial research through significant improvements in reliability and robustness of classification and localisation in image space~\cite{alom_history_2018}.\\
Kuipers~\cite{kuipers_spatial_2000} connected places, defined as 0D ''points'', through 1D ''paths'' with 2D ''regions'' in topological maps. The proposed maps had a sensory and control level, a causal level, a topological level and a metrical level, all of which were connnected hierarchically. Together with his colleagues, Kuipers~\cite{kuipers_local_2004} also conducted experiments where local metric room representations were linked through topological constraints.~\todo{This is not yet in the graphic. INCLUDE!}. Galindo~\etal~\cite{galindo_robot_2008} connected a spatial hierarchical representation consisting of areas and objects with a terminological box and connected between these two in a deterministic manner to enable inference and path planning. Borkowski~\etal~\cite{borkowski_towards_2010} assigned a hierarchical place taxomony based on house representations from architecture to a metric map and performed path-planning within this map while considering semantic constraints. Tenorth~\cite{tenorth_knowrob-map_2010} built a topological representation of abstract objects and locations and associates these in a hierarchical fashion to enhance task planning by incorporating the relations of objects. Krishnan and Krishna~\cite{krishnan_visual_2010} constructed a hierarchical semantical-topological and explored the semantic nodes before proceeding to the next. Zhang~\etal~\cite{zhang_hierarchical_2019} used a hierarchical topic model to improve the performance of a SLAM system by actively integrating the object association problem into a hierarchical dirichlet process.\\
Chaplot~\etal~\cite{chaplot_object_2020} won the 2020 CVPR challenge to navigate to an object goal by learning a semantic-metric map from visual cues and training a policy to generate frontier-based goals. Their research also highlighted that other RL policies were outperformed by frontier-based methods and were unable to generalize to the real-world.
\subsubsection{UAVs} \label{sssec:ResLitUAV}
\begin{figure*}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Results-13.png}
    \caption{\bf{
        Results calculated by equation~\ref{eq:Entropy} of the two best performing algorithms, algorithm 2 and the proposed algorithm 4, subtracted from one another and related through equation~\ref{eq:eval}. The vertical black dashed line indicates the $\mathbf{50}$\% threshold. Values lower than the threshold represent a worse performance of the proposed algorithm 4.
    }}
    \label{fig:Res}
\end{figure*}
Thirteen UAV-based research efforts from $2013$ onwards have been included in this taxonomy, which present a variety of approaches of including semantic information. A substantial amount of literature is concerned with passive acquisition of semantic information: 
Le Saux and Sanfourche~\cite{saux_rapid_2013}, Sheppard and Rahnemoonfar~\cite{sheppard_real-time_2017}, Christie~\etal~\cite{christie_semantics_2016} and Kyrkou~\etal~\cite{kyrkou_dronet:_2018}, classified top-down images taken from a UAV. Cavaliere~\etal~\cite{cavaliere_towards_2016,cavaliere_towards_2018} associated ''tracks'' coming from images with ''places'' from geospatial information to describe relations between them in a relational manner, as detailed in~\cite{landsiedel_review_2017}. The individual items were structured hierarchically to distinguish between different type of tracks, such as vehicles and humans on the first level and cars, motorcycles and trucks on the second level. Drouilly~\etal~\cite{drouilly_semantic_2015} developed a metric to evaluate the semantic quality of a path through an environment depending on the distribution of objects and the observation quality.

Semantic information has also been employed in active navigation. Maturana~\etal~\cite{maturana_looking_2017} annotated a 2.5D map with detection of cars and developed a system to approach the cars using UAVs. Maravall~\etal~\cite{maravall_navigation_2017} used the image entropy to navigate through a topological map to semantically salient places. Alirezaie~\cite{alirezaie_exploiting_2017} developed a RRT implementation that discards semantically inadmissible points through geospatial information associated with the waypoints and significantly improved planning time for longer distances. Dang~\etal~\cite{dang_autonomous_2018} employed an object detector on top of a voxel grid to detect humans and bicycles. Koch~\etal~\cite{koch_automatic_2019} respected semantic constraints during the path planning step for 3D reconstruction using UAVs while maintaining the quality of the reconstruction.
Toudeshki~\etal~\cite{toudeshki_robust_2018} combined a visual teach-and-repeat approach with an object detector to funnel the UAV to follow a path.
\subsubsection{Summary} \label{sssec:ResLitSum}
Fusing semantic information with spatial information for navigation, mapping or task-planning has been an active field of research for the past decades. A majority of research fuses information into hybrid models, either on the semantic or on the spatial axis. This is demonstrated by the centralised cluster as shown in figure~\ref{fig:LitRes}. UAV research is more spread out than other approaches in this figure.

The centralised clustering indicates that research has benefitted from hybrid approaches, which have not yet been translated to UAVs due to the hurdle of additional complexity. Based on these insights, an algorithm and a simulation scenario with reduced complexity are proposed.
\subsection{Simulations} \label{ssec:ResSim}
Numerical simulations were conducted to test the performance of the algorithms under different conditions. Figure~\ref{fig:Res} displays the results of the numerical simulations evaluated on the second simulation environment, $s=2$. Preliminary experiments showed that the second algorithm, which predicts yet unobserved cells with a mixture of $\alpha = 0.5$ always outperformed the weakest baseline and largely outperformed the second, hierarchical baseline. Therefore, results are presented which compare the hierarchical dynamic prediction of $p(x)$ through $p(u)$ and $p(x\mid u)$ with the prediction through the mixture component of $\alpha = 0.5$. A total of $1975$ simulation cases are included in this evaluation. The height of the bar indicates the percentage of outperformance, as indicated by equation~\ref{eq:eval}. A value below the threshold of $50$ \% indicates a worse performance.

The bars for \emph{Dim} and \emph{Fov} -- $f$ in table~\ref{tab:params} -- indicate that neither the dimensions of the map $M$, nor an extended field of view $f$ lead to an improvement of one algorithm over the other. \emph{Transp} and \emph{Test} -- $t$ and $c$ in table~\ref{tab:params} respectively -- also do not significantly influence the result.

The decreasing bars for the accuracy-parameter in figure~\ref{fig:Res} indicate that the influence of the prior diminishes when the detection accuracy improves, which is aligned with the intuition of Bayesian filtering, as the detections converge to the true state. The increasing performance with increasing overlap $o$ -- which is running in parallel for both axes -- show that the additional observations benefit the hierarchical algorithm more than a linear mixing. The higher value for the \emph{Rand} parameter -- $r$ in table~\ref{tab:params} -- show that even in a randomized setting, the hierarchical prediction can lead to increased performance. The low value for \emph{Ptu} case 0 shows that a manually defined detection parameter performs significantly worse, however, the high values for 1 and 2 indicate that with the right parameters for $p(u)$ and $p(x\mid u)$, the performance can increase significantly.

Figure~\ref{fig:SampRes} shows two reproductions of example cases, with the entropy value of the map as calculated by equation~\ref{eq:Entropy} in the header. Both cases show the second simulation environment used for testing, $s = 2$, with an overlap $o = 0.5$, $f = 1$ and $t= 0 $ as defined in table~\ref{tab:params}. As evident, both approaches perform much better than the baseline, which is indicated by the noise in the reproduction. The first row shows an example case where the proposed algorithm was outperformed by algorithm 2, albeit by a small margin. This case represents a test configuration of $c = 0$, $r = 0$ accuracy of $0.8$ and $Ptu = 0$.  In the second row the parameters are: $c =1$, $r = 1$, accuracy $0.7$ and $Ptu = 2$.
Despite performing better than the other algorithms, the reproduction is much worse than with a higher detector accuracy which points to the significant influence of this parameter. This is shown by the large gap between row I and II for the Naive Bayes classifier, which assumes independence between individual cells and is therefore not influenced by spatial variations $c$ and $r$. However, in row II the log-likelihood decreases with a change in algorithm, despite the randomness and convolution throughout the map, which indicates that the proposed algorithm increases the performance, if the right spatial parameters can be retrieved. Manually defining these, despite best guesses, does not yield the desired result, as can be seen in column d) of figure~\ref{fig:SampRes} and underlined by the significant decrease with \emph{Ptu} in figure~\ref{fig:Res}.
\section{Discussion} \label{sec:Disc}
This work has categorized twenty-six papers with respect to spatial map, semantic map and robot type for the purpose of gathering information on the benefits and challenges in image space, topological and metric representations and subsequently developed an algorithm used in the development pipeline shown in figure~\ref{fig:DevProcess}. The algorithm has been tested in numerical simulations before proceeding with subsequent development steps.
\subsection{Literature Taxonomy} \label{ssec:DiscLit}
The taxonomy of twenty-six papers, even though not exhaustive, highlights significant factors that influence the synergy between semantic and spatial information. Not targeting robotics and therefore not included in the taxonomy is the relevant work by Harnad on symbolic systems~\cite{harnad_symbol_1990}, which discusses the association of sensory inputs with symbolic systems and intricate representations. Kostavelis and Gasteratos have completed an extensive literature review of semantic mapping for mobile robotics~\cite{kostavelis_semantic_2015} and Landsiedel~\etal~\cite{landsiedel_review_2017} have reviewed spatial relations in robotics. The taxonomy presented in this paper highlights the dimensions of semantic and spatial information with respect to the robot type and possible trends to drive the development of an algorithm.

The clustering of UAV-based semantic research in the corners of figure~\ref{fig:LitRes} indicates that mixing hierarchical information for UAVs is not an easy task. While enormous datasets and challenges along with unified metrics have driven computer vision research~\cite{alom_history_2018,corke_what_2020} and are starting to show the benefits in navigation~\cite{anderson_evaluation_2018,chaplot_object_2020}, UAVs are facing additional challenges.
On the one hand the viewpoint of UAVs compared to generalised image datasets is unique, with oblique and top-down viewing points decreasing the accuracy of detectors~\cite{richardwebster_psyphy:_2019}. On the other hand, UAVs face additional obstacles with safety considerations, as well as reduced computational capabilities~\cite{boroujerdian_mavbench_2018,mandel_method_2020}. Furthermore, increasingly complex architectures and differing quality requirements can cause difficulties in deploying algorithms~\cite{cervera_try_2019,malatova_how_2020}. 
Semantic research generally benefits from unified metrics~\cite{anderson_evaluation_2018}, simulation environments and challenges~\cite{chaplot_object_2020,yang_visual_2018}. The driving force of standardised environments and challenges~\cite{corke_what_2020} can also be seen in the UAV community, as exhibited by the development of autonomous drone racing algorithms~\cite{moon_challenges_2019}.

Chown~\etal~\cite{chown_prototypes_1995} emphasize the importance of ''gateways'' as transitions between regions, which arise naturally in manmade houses and have been used in many research efforts for ground-based vechicles~\cite{kuipers_local_2004,wu_learning_2018,krishnan_visual_2010}, however, may be difficult to define for UAVs. Where an area ends and another begins may be ambiguous for large outdoor environments, which are usually covered by UAVs~\cite{vanegas_novel_2018,shetty_implementation_2020}, whereas rooms often provide a natural separation in indoor environments. Furthermore, definitions of semantic area, region, or scene, if representing a spatial extent, could not be identified from the literature and the borders may be fluid between all of these defintions depending on the task and research field.

\subsection{Simulations} \label{ssec:DiscSim}
The results of the simulations indicate that incorporating spatial correlation can benefit the assignment of class names to grid cells, which is aligned with general robotic mapping approaches~\cite{thrun_probabilistic_2005}, as well as the intuition behind convolutions in general. The inclusion of explicitly hierarchical information into a mapping pipeline can be beneficial, but is largely dependant on the robustness of the model, much like topic modelling approaches~\cite{fei-fei_bayesian_2005,blei_latent_2003}.

In this research, important hardware parameters such as flying velocity and battery charge~\cite{boroujerdian_mavbench_2018} have been omitted for simplicity. Furthermore, the simulation environment is a reduced to a manually-defined version, because no standardised simulation environment for semantic mapping for UAVs could be identified and therefore exhibits a natural bias. The simplicity has been attempted to be counteracted through the consideration of parameters $c$, $t$ and $r$ to increase the diversity of test cases.   
The reliance on detection parameters is demonstrated through the significant drop in performance for \emph{Ptu} as seen in figure~\ref{fig:Res} and the convergence of the performance with increasing accuracy. With perfect detectors the filtering approach would not be necessary, however, despite increasing performance~\cite{alom_history_2018} the quality of conventional detections is decreased for UAVs by unique viewpoints~\cite{richardwebster_psyphy:_2019} and computational constraints~\cite{krishnan_sky_2020}. The hierarchical approach proposed in this research is largely dependant on the parameters $p(u)$ and $p(x\mid u)$, as clearly by figure~\ref{fig:Res}, which could be learned from data with an appropriate generative model~\cite{blei_latent_2003,lienou_semantic_2010}.
\section{Future Work} \label{sec:Fut}
Learning the parameters of the hierarchical model would require a formalised definition of the generative probabilistic model. Semantics, as the study of signs and the things to which they refer~\cite{kostavelis_semantic_2015}, has profound roots in language. Computer scientists working with language have put large efforts into attempting to model spoken and written language. Spoken language has employed hierarchical models of language based on the Markov assumption to separate spoken words~\cite{fine_hierarchical_1998,murphy_dynamic_2002}, which have been translated to alternative purposes, such as motion prediction~\cite{li_layered_2015} and motion recognition~\cite{oliver_layered_2002,aarno_layered_2006}. Natural Language Processing has put significant efforts into into classifying words into topics and documents (which are considered mixtures of topics) for classification and proposition~\cite{blei_latent_2003,hofmann_unsupervised_2001}, which has been adapted for the task of scene anotation in computer vision~\cite{bosch_scene_2006,fei-fei_bayesian_2005} and on satellite images~\cite{lienou_semantic_2010}. Learning the parameters from data analogous to these models would enable the model to be extended further, such as the incorporation of location uncertainty.

Further research will focus on progressing the model through an approriate generative model. Subsequent tests as defined in figure~\ref{fig:DevProcess} will enable an embedding into higher-level frameworks for semantic navigation~\cite{mandel_towards_2020,vanegas_uncertainty_2016} and finally deployment on a UAV~\cite{mandel_method_2020}.
